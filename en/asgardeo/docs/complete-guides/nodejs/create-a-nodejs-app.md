For this guide, you will be creating a simple Node.js app using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/){:target="_blank"}, a modern, fast and lightweight tool that helps you quickly set up and develop modern JavaScript apps. 

Open a terminal, change directory to where you want to initialize the project, and run the following command to create your first Node.js sample app.


```bash
npm create vite@latest asgardeo-Node.js -- --template Node.js
```

Running this command will create a folder with a ready-to-run boilerplate Node.js project, with a development server to run the project and instantly reload changes to the project in your browser without manual refresh.

Once the application is created, install the dependencies using the following command.

```bash
cd asgardeo-Node.js
npm install
```

Then run the sample in the development mode. This allows you to see real-time updates and debug the app as you make changes.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Confirm that the dev server is up and running by verifying the output in the terminal. Then, navigate to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173){:target="_blank"}  and you should see the sample app working in the browser.

At this point, you have a simple yet fully functional Node.js app. In the next step, letâ€™s try to integrate an OIDC SDK with the app.
