# Add Github login

You can add Github login to your applications using {{ product_name }} and enable users to log in with their Github account.

Follow this guide for instructions.

## Register {{ product_name }} on Github

You need to register {{ product_name }} as an OAuth app on GitHub.

!!! note
    You can follow the [Github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app) for detailed instructions.

1. Log in to [Github](https://github.com/), click your profile icon, and click **Settings**.
2. On the left panel of the **Settings** page, click **Developer settings**.
3. Under **OAuth apps**, click **Register a new application**.

4. Give the application a name and the following URLs:
    
    - **Homepage URL**
        ```bash 
        {{ product_url_format }}
        ```
    
    - **Authorization callback URL**
        ```bash
        {{ product_url_format }}/commonauth
        ```

    ![Enter Github app details]({{base_path}}/assets/img/guides/idp/github-idp/github-app-info.png){: width="600" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; border: 0.3px solid lightgrey;"}

5. Click **Register application**.
6. Generate a new client secret and take note of the **Client ID** and **Client secret**.

## Register the Github IdP

Now, let's register the Github IdP in {{ product_name }}.

1. On the {{ product_name }} Console, go to **Connections**.
2. Click **New Connections** and select **Github**.
3. Enter the following details and click **Finish**:

    ![Add Github IDP in {{ product_name }}]({{base_path}}/assets/img/guides/idp/github-idp/add-github-idp.png){: width="600" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; border: 0.3px solid lightgrey;"}

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Parameter</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Name</td>
        <td>A unique name for this Github identity provider.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Client ID</td>
          <td>The client ID obtained from Github.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Client secret</td>
          <td>The client secret obtained from Github.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

4. If required, you can [disable JIT user provisioning]({{base_path}}/guides/authentication/jit-user-provisioning/).

??? note "Claim syncing for JIT-provisioned users"
      [JIT user provisioning]({{base_path}}/guides/authentication/jit-user-provisioning/) is enabled by default for your external identity provider. If required, you can [disable JIT user provisioning]({{base_path}}/guides/authentication/jit-user-provisioning/#disable-jit-user-provisioning).

      When a user with a local {{ product_name }} account uses the same email address to log in through an external identity provider, {{ product_name }} syncs the claims from the JIT-provisioned user account and the local account.

      According to the default behavior of {{ product_name }}, when JIT user provisioning is enabled, the user claims of the local user account are overridden by the user claims received from the external identity provider.

      You can use {{ product_name }}'s [identity provider APIs]({{base_path}}/apis/idp/#tag/Provisioning/operation/getJITConfig) to configure claim syncing between the external identity provider and the local user accounts. This gives you the flexibility to customize the claim syncing behavior according to your specific requirements.

After the GitHub identity provider is created, go to the **Settings** tab and see the list of **scopes** to which Github has granted permissions.

- **email**: Grants read access to a user's primary email address.
- **public_profile**: Grants read access to a user's default public profile details.  

!!! note
    {{ product_name }} needs these scopes to get user information. {{ product_name }} checks the attribute configurations of the application and sends the relevant attributes received from Github to the app. You can read the [Github Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps) to learn more.

## Enable GitHub login

!!! note "Before you begin"
    You need to [register an application with {{ product_name }}]({{base_path}}/guides/applications/). You can register your own application or use one of the [sample applications]({{base_path}}/get-started/try-samples/) provided.

1. On the {{ product_name }} Console, go to **Applications**.
2. Select your application, go to the **Sign-in Method** tab and add Github login from your preferred editor:

    !!! note "Recommendations"
        {{ product_name }} recommends adding your social and enterprise connections to the first authentication step, as they are used for identifying the user.

4. Log in to GitHub with an existing user account.
