# Migrate users to {{ product_name }}

Organization owners may need to migrate users from an existing Identity Provider (IdP) to {{ product_name }} for the following reasons:

- To combine users of multiple systems to a single IdP for proper user management.
- To reorganize, restructure, and simplify user data storage.
- To combine user data storages to ease centralized user management and to facilitate company acquisitions and mergers.
- To move or separate identity data due to geopolitical, data protection, compliance, and regulatory reasons.
- To improve identity management by providing increased security, scalability, and reduced maintenance costs.
