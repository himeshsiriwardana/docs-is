# Migrate passwords to Asgardeo

You may use one of the following two ways to migrate user passwords to Asgardeo.

## Migrate with password reset

This method involves the least administrative effort but causes the most friction for users. With a password reset, users will receive an email prompting them to set a password for their new Asgardeo accounts. Until they set a password, their user accounts will remain locked to prevent unauthorized access. Additionally, this method allows you to immediately terminate operations on your previous IdP once the user accounts are successfully migrated to Asgardeo.

If you wish to migrate user passwords using this method, inform the Asgardeo team along with your request to [migrate users](#migrate-users).

## Migrate with on-demand silent migration

Compared to password reset method above, on-demand silent password migration involves more effort to set up but provides the user with a seamless password migration experience. The following are the high level steps involved with this method.

1. The user logs in to the application.

2. The application redirects the user to the Asgardeo login screen.

3. The user enters the credentials used for the account in the legacy IdP.

4. If Asgardeo has already migrated the user's password, the user is logged in. If not, the user is redirected to a waiting page.

5. Asgardeo makes an authentication request to the legacy IdP with the user provided credentials.

6. If successful, Asgardeo migrates the password for the user.

7. The user is successfully logged in and may use the same credentials used for the legacy IdP to log in with Asgardeo.

If you wish to migrate users with this method, it is crucial to note that the legacy IdP should run alongside Asgardeo for a set period to facilitate user migration. Additionally it's essential to have a contingency plan to migrate any accounts that were not migrated while the legacy IdP is active. Unmigrated users must contact the Asgardeo organization administrators to initiate a password reset process, facilitating a smooth and complete transition to Asgardeo.

Follow the steps below to implement on-demand silent password migration.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure the following are fulfilled.

- [Migrate user accounts to Asgardeo]({{base_path}}/guides/users/migrate-users-to-asgardeo/migrate-users/).
- Ensure your legacy IdP provides means to perform basic user authentication (i.e. username and password authentication). For example, a SCIM2/Me REST API endpoint that could be authenticated with username and password.
- You need to have a Github repository to host the authentication service.
- Download [Ballerina](https://ballerina.io/downloads/){target="_blank"}, the programming language used to define the external authentication service.

### Step 1: Develop the authentication service

In this section, we will develop an authentication service that will communicate with the legacy IdP to authenticate users.

!!! note
    You may find a sample Ballerina authentication service [here](https://github.com/wso2/samples-is/tree/master/user-migration-samples/asgardeo/external-authentication-service){target="_blank"}.

1. Create a new Ballerina package. Learn how to do so in the [Ballerina documentation](https://ballerina.io/learn/get-started/){target="_blank"}.

2. Write a [RESTful service](https://ballerina.io/learn/write-a-restful-api-with-ballerina/){target="_blank"} that communicates with the legacy authentication system to perform user authentication. Your service should expose the following REST API endpoints.

    !!! tip
        
        External authentication might take a significant processing time depending on the legacy IdP and network delays. Therefore it is recommended to perform the external authentication asynchronously without holding an active connection until the external authentication process completes.

    - **Start authentication endpoint** - to initiate the authentication process with the legacy system. This endpoint should accept the request, return a response with a unique random identifier (preferably a UUID) and then start the external authentication process.

    - **Authentication status endpoint** - to retrieve and return the completed authentication result.

    - **Polling endpoint** - to return the completion status of the external authentication task. This should be an open endpoint that doesnâ€™t require any authentication.

    !!! warning "Adding logs"

        We highly recommend adding sufficient logging when developing the REST service. However, ensure no sensitive information or Personally Identifiable Information (PII) are included in the logs.

3. Commit your changes and push the code to your remote Github repository.

### Step 2: Create and deploy the RESTful service in Choreo

We will now deploy the developed authentication service in [Choreo]({{base_path}}/https://wso2.com/choreo/){target="_blank"}, WSO2's integration platform. To do so,

1. Go to the [Choreo Console](https://console.choreo.dev/login){target="_blank"} and login with the SAME email address you used to create your Asgardeo organization.

    !!! note

        An organization with the same name as your Asgardeo organization will be created for you in Choreo.

2. On the top of the Console, create a new project or select an existing one.

3. On the left panel, select **Components** and click **Create**.

4. On the **Select a type** tab, select **Service**.

    ![Select a type of component]({{base_path}}/assets/img/guides/users/migrate-users/create-a-component.png)

    !!! note

        Learn more about service components in the [Choreo documentation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/develop-services/service-component-overview/){target="_blank"}

5. Enter a name and description for your service.

6. Click **Authorize with Github** and connect the relevant organization, repository and the branch for the developed authentication service in step 1.

7. Select **Ballerina** to be the buildpack and select the Ballerina project directory from your Github repository.

    ![Enter details of the service component]({{base_path}}/assets/img/guides/users/migrate-users/service-details.png)

8. Click **Create**.

9. Build and deploy the service. See [Choreo documentation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/develop-services/develop-a-service/#step-2-build-and-deploy){target="_blank"} for instructions.

    !!! note

        If you are using the sample authentication service, be sure to provide values for the necessary configurations before you deploy the service.

10. As discussed earlier, the polling endpoint should be an open endpoint. Follow the steps below to configure this.

    1. Go to **Deployment** and in the **Set up** card, click **Endpoint Configurations**.

    2. In the window that appears, under **Permissions**, expand the polling endpoint and turn the **Security** toggle off. 

        ![Make the polling endpoint open]({{base_path}}/assets/img/guides/users/migrate-users/polling-make-open-endpoint.png)

    3. Click **Apply** to save the changes.

11. On the left navigation, go to **Manage** > **Lifecycle** and click **Publish**.

### Step 3: Create a Choreo application to consume the APIs

After the RESTful service is deployed, follow the steps below to create an application in Choreo and subscribe it to the REST API. This application will later be used to integrate the REST APIs with the Asgardeo application.

1. Sign in to the [Choreo Developer Portal](https://devportal.choreo.dev/){target="_blank"} with the same email address you used to log in to the Choreo Console in step 2.

2. On the top navigation, go to **Applications** and click **Create Application**.

3. Provide a name and a description for the application and click **Create**.

4. On the left navigation, go to **Credentials** and click **Generate Credentials**.

5. Take note of the generated consumer key and consumer secret as you will need it later.

6. On the left navigation, go to **Subscriptions** and click **Add APIs**.

7. Click **Add** corresponding to the API that you created in step 2.

!!! note

    To learn more about applications in Choreo, refer to the [Choreo documentation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/consuming-services/manage-application/#create-an-application){target="_blank"}.


### Step 4: Configure an attribute in Asgardeo to hold the migration status

Asgardeo should have means to check whether a user's password is migrated or not. This can be achieved by creating a user attribute in Asgardeo to hold the migration status. To do so,

1. On the Asgardeo Console, go to **User Attributes & Stores** > **Attributes** and click on **Attirubtes**.

2. Click **New Attribute** and enter the following details: 

    <table>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Attribute name</b></td>
            <td>is_migrated</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Attribute Display Name</b></td>
            <td>Password migration status</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

3. Click **Finish** to create the attribute.

### Step 5: Configure the login flow of the Asgardeo application

You are now ready to configure your application for on-demand silent password migration. To do so,

1. On the Asgardeo Console, click **Application**.

2. Select the application and go to its **Login Flow** tab.

3. Configure the login flow using your preferred editor:

    === "Classic Editor"

        To configure the login flow using the classic editor:

        1. Click **Start with default configuration** or add the **Username & Password** authenticator to the first step of the flow.
        
        2. Turn on Conditional Authentication by switching on the toggle.

            ![Make the polling endpoint open]({{base_path}}/assets/img/guides/users/migrate-users/migrate-users-classic.png)

        3. Replace any existing code with this [conditional authentication script]({{base_path}}/guides/authentication/conditional-auth/on-demand-silent-password-migration-template/).

    === "Visual Editor"

        To configure the login flow using the visual editor:

        1. Switch to the Visual Editor tab.

        2. If **Username & Password** authentication is not set, go to **Predefined flows** > **Basic Login Flows** > **Add Basic Login** and select it to add to the login flow.

        3. Turn on Conditional Authentication by switching on the toggle.

             ![Make the polling endpoint open]({{base_path}}/assets/img/guides/users/migrate-users/migrate-users-visual.png){: width="500"}

        4. Replace any existing code with this [conditional authentication script]({{base_path}}/guides/authentication/conditional-auth/on-demand-silent-password-migration-template/).

4. Click **Update** to save the changes.

### Try it out

Follow the steps below to try out on-demand silent password migration for a migrated user account.

1. Access the application URL.

2. Log in to Asgardeo with the user credentials used for the legacy IdP.

3. If the user's password is not yet migrated, you'll be redirected to a waiting page as follows.

    ![Wait page]({{base_path}}/assets/img/guides/users/migrate-users/wait-page.png){: width="400"}

4. Asgardeo will migrate the password and log the user in once the external authentication is successful.
