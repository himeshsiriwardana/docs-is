# {{ product_name }} user roles

Roles consist of the permissions that are required by users to access the {{ product_name }} resources such as functions available on the {{ product_name }} Console, REST APIs, etc.

When you assign a role to a user, you are controlling what the user can do in {{ product_name }}.

By default, {{ product_name }} has the **{{ admin_role_name }}** user role. This role includes all administrative permissions in the organization. An organization can have many users with the
{{ admin_role_name }} role. An {{ admin_role_name }} is a privileged user who has overall access to the organization.

<!-- 2. **Application developer**: This role includes the permissions required for registering and managing applications. The application developer is a privileged user who can integrate applications with {{ product_name }}. 

3. **Administrative auditor**: This role includes list and view permissions to {{ product_name }} resources, which is useful in troubleshooting issues and providing support for other users in the organization. This role provides users read only access to the organization.

Only [Administrators]({{base_path}}/guides/users/manage-administrators/) can be assigned to {{ product_name }} roles, and an administrator can be assigned only with one role.

The following tables list the permissions enabled for roles in the organization. -->
